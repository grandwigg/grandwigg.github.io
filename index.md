I may have grand designs and plans in mind, but a Wigg can only cover so much scalp.

My interests generally include things such as amateur radio, homelab and home automation. Though I don't feel the need to limit myself to this alone.

There will be no apologies for sudden and overwhelming floods of images or stories of my German Shepherd, Max.

In any account, thanks for your time or patience.
